            Hey there and welcome to my little corner of the internet. You have
            probably already noticed, this website is kind of a mess. Let me
            just say it upfront, I cannot code. At all.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if things look a bit weird or feel like they were thrown together
            during a caffeine-fueled panic, well, now you know why. I made this
            website using a mix of determination, random tutorials, and asking
            Google a lot of embarrassing questions like, "What even is HTML?"
            The result is this delightful disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, so this website is not perfect, but neither am I. And
            honestly, that is the point. This messy little creation is proof
            that you can do something even if you have no clue what you are
            doing. Sometimes you just have to dive in, even if it means things
            end up looking a little, well, like this. Anyway, feel free to click
            around, but fair warning, some things might not work. Or they might
            work too well and crash your browser. Who knows. If you want to say
            hi, share your thoughts, or even offer tips to fix this thing, I
            would love to hear from you. Unless you are here to roast me. ehe.
